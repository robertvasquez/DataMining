This is what we are going to need to do:
[Time Series Analysis](http://wiki.pentaho.com/display/DATAMINING/Time+Series+Analysis+and+Forecasting+with+Weka)

**USAGE:**

1. Download Weka Development version. Open package manager and install Time Series Forecast near the bottom.
2. If would like to see how sorting of States works, run ClimateCleanStates
3. Run ClimateCleanDatesAscending and provide state abbreviation.
4. Run ClimateCleanAverage and provide state abbreviation
5. Open the new .arff file in Weka and use the Forecast tool. Set time units of forecast (optional).
6. Select attributes and click start. 
7. Click Train future pred. tab to view the graph. Can also zoom in. 


**Data Analysis Project:**

In this type of project, the student will apply various data mining algorithms to analyze several data sets and report on interesting knowledge and patterns learned from the analysis.

**Technical Requirements:**

At least two large data sets (say more than 10000 records) should be analyzed. The data sets should contain real-world data (look beyond the UCI repository). Some data sources are listed in this page additional data sets may be found on the Web.
Use an existing data mining package, such as Weka or DB2Miner, to perform the mining tasks. The data sets may need to be pre-processed to enable the analysis.

There should be clearly define the purpose of the data analysis with respected to the data sets. The project should utilize various types of data mining algorithms to perform well-defined data analysis tasks. There should be some  evaluation of the interestingness of the  knowledge models/patterns found in the analysis.

**Proposal Requirements:**

In addition to the general requirements of the project proposal, describe which data sets you plan to mine (or where you plan to go to looking for data sets), what types of knowledge/pattern you plan to discover, what software package(s), programming languages, and OS you plan to use to process data and run the packages.

**Progress Report Requirements:**

In addition to the general requirements of the progress report, describe the tasks you have completed and the tasks remaining, any revision to the original goals and new data sets and knowledge model/pattern, if any, that you included into the project. Also include a revised time line for the remaining tasks.

**Final Report Requirements. In addition to the general requirements of the final report, it should also satisfy the following requirements:**

The report should provide details of the data sets, data mining tasks, the results and quality interpretation of the results. 
The report should have a title page, an introduction section, one section for each type of mining tasks performed, and a conclusion section. The report should also include any figures, charts, etc. that are in the output of the software used in the analysis. It is important to make sure that the description is clear enough so that the reader with a reasonable effort is able to repeat your analysis and get a comparable result.

Discuss interesting results discovered and explain why the results are interesting. This perhaps will require you to discuss the content of the data sets and the application area that the data describes.
If you have written programs to pre-process data, provide some details including but not restricted tothe purpose of the operations, the basic methods, the reasons for choosing certain parameters, any problem encountered, and any experience gained.

Comment on your experience in the project and if your team has more than one person, describe the work done by each team member.

Submit the data sets, program source code, and the final report in a zip file named cs4593-yourName.zip. The data sets and source code should be separate from the final report. Also include in the submission a README file that provides compilation and execution instructions. If you program is in Java, also include the jar file of your program.

**Presentation:**

Each project team should do a 10 to 15 minutes presentation about the course project. The presentation schedule will be made available on the Blackboard. It is suggested that you prepare 4-5 slides and give a highlight of your projects. The slides should be in a PDF file. The slides should be submitted after the presentation is done.
